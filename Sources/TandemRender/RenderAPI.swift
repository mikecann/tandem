// Contract for the render module. The API and the app build against these
// signatures; the work happens in the rest of the module (see
// docs/RENDER.md), and `LayerMath` has the placement maths for the viewer.
//
// Transform contract (the viewer and export must agree exactly):
// - The source frame is scaled so the whole frame fits the canvas
//   (aspect fit), then multiplied by `transform.scale`.
// - `transform.position` is where the centre of the (uncropped) source lands,
//   in canvas units: (0, 0) top left, (1, 1) bottom right.
// - `transform.rotation` is degrees clockwise about that centre.
// - `crop` hides fractions of the source edges without rescaling.
// - Opacity multiplies the layer, its shadow included, and the cutout matte
//   is applied before the shadow, so the shadow follows the person.
// - Video tracks draw bottom to top: `videoTracks[0]` first.
