# Asset library

Music, sound effects, stickers, overlays, B-roll, fonts, icons and logos in
one browser, from several sources, with the licence of every asset recorded.
Research from 2026-09-25 checked about 45 sources against their API, pricing
and licence pages; this is what it decided.

## What Mike uses (Filmora audit, 51 projects)

- A music bed in 42 projects (about -31 dB, 2 s fade out).
- Sound effects in 29 projects, 393 clips: whooshes, clicks, typing (about -15 dB).
- Animated stickers in 28 projects, 142 clips, 60 different ones, mostly used once.
- Title templates in 40 projects. Stock video in 18. LUTs in 1.

So music, SFX, stickers and titles come first. LUTs can wait.

## Licensing findings that shape the design

- Filmora's asset licence forbids using its assets outside Filmora, and a
  company channel needs Filmora's Business plan, which excludes the asset
  library. Nothing from Filmora's store moves to Tandem, and past use on the
  Convex channel may not have been covered. Tandem records the licence of
  every asset so this can't happen quietly again.
- Personal plans (Epidemic Creator, Artlist Social, Storyblocks Individual,
  Musicbed Individual) exclude company or client work.
- Few sources give an individual a download API: Epidemic Sound (personal key
  MCP endpoint), ElevenLabs, Freesound, Lordicon, Pexels, Pixabay, plus the
  free Iconify, Fontsource, Google Fonts, SVGL and Noto emoji. Envato,
  Artlist, Storyblocks, Motion Array, Musicbed, Mixkit and the YouTube Audio
  Library need an import folder instead (most ban scripted downloads).
- Dead or unusable: Tenor's API (shut down 30 Jun 2026), GIPHY (no caching,
  non-commercial user terms), LottieFiles free plan (5 downloads total),
  Shadertoy (defaults to non-commercial), Stability's local models (company
  revenue cap), SF Symbols (Apple UI only, never in videos).

## Catalogue

- SQLite with FTS5 (system `sqlite3`), in `~/Library/Application Support/Tandem/Assets/catalog.sqlite`.
- Asset rows: provider, provider ID, kind (music, sfx, sticker, overlay, video,
  image, font, icon, logo, lut, title, transition), name, tags, duration, BPM,
  key, has alpha, size, sha256, state (remote, preview, original, normalised),
  credit line, favourite, last used.
- A licence table snapshots the terms (and any certificate) at download time.
- A usage table (asset, project, time) drives Recently used, "In this project",
  description credits and proof for Content ID disputes.

## Disk layout

```
~/Library/Application Support/Tandem/Assets/<provider>/<id>/
  meta.json  thumbnail.jpg  original.<ext>  normalised.<ext>  peaks.bin  loudness.json
~/Library/Caches/Tandem/AssetPreviews/     size-capped, least recently used goes first
```

Originals are pinned while favourited or used in a project. Using a
downloaded, generated or import folder asset in a project copies it into the
project's `assets/` folder so projects stay self-contained. A different file
already there under the same name (a copy Mike reworked, or an older version
the timeline still plays) is never replaced: the new copy goes beside it.
Shared library assets are the exception: they're used where they are (see
below).

## The shared library

One visible folder on this Mac for everything Mike reuses across videos:
`~/Movies/Tandem Library` (Backblaze backs it up with the rest of the Mac).
Tandem > Settings… moves it; the choice is `sharedLibrary` in the asset
library's `settings.json`, and `$TANDEM_LIBRARY` moves it for one process.
An asset library anywhere other than the standard place (tests,
`$TANDEM_ASSETS_ROOT`) keeps its shared library inside itself, `<root>/Tandem
Library`, so nothing but the app touches the real one. The app makes the
folder the first time it opens after installing; opening the library
(the CLI, MCP, tests) never does.

```
~/Movies/Tandem Library/
  README.txt                what the folder is for
  Stickers/                 animated stickers: HEVC with alpha, WebM, GIF, WebP, Lottie
  Graphics/                 logos, lower thirds, overlays, stills (PNG, JPEG, SVG, MOV)
  Sound effects/
  Music/
  Looks/                    colour looks as .cube LUTs
  Fonts/                    TTF, OTF, TTC for titles
  Segments/<name>/          saved segments: segment.json and the media they play
```

Each folder has a README. Tandem never writes over one Mike edited.

**How it's indexed.** `SharedLibraryProvider` (source `shared`, the "Shared
library" chip) indexes the folder with the import folder machinery and
watches it with FSEvents, so a file dropped in shows up in its tab within a
second or so, searchable, with its thumbnail (made as its tile comes into
view) or waveform. A file's folder says what it is: anything in Music is
music however short, sounds in Sound effects are SFX, pictures in Stickers
are stickers, pictures in Graphics are overlays (logos when the name says
so; SVGs by their name), LUTs in Looks and fonts in Fonts. Subfolder names
become search words. `Segments/` and the READMEs aren't indexed. Asset IDs
are the path inside the library (`shared:Stickers/Party/Dance.gif`), so they
survive the library moving; a row whose file is somewhere else now is
described again. Licences: the nearest `tandem-licence.json` at or above a
file covers it (one in the library's top folder for Mike's own things,
another in `Sound effects/Envato/` for a subscription); without one a file
is Unknown licence, and the credits say so. Fonts in `Fonts/` are
registered by whatever renders a project (the app, `tandem serve`, a CLI
export) along with the project's own `assets/font/`, so titles can use them
without installing them for the whole Mac; archiving copies the ones a
project uses into it.

**Reference, don't copy.** Using a shared asset (double-click, drag,
`tandem assets use shared:...`) adds the library's file to the project where
it is, by its absolute path, and records the use for the credits. Nothing is
copied into `assets/`, so improving a sticker or re-exporting an intro in
the library improves every project that uses it the next time it plays or
renders. Files a project can't play as they are (WebM, Lottie, SVG, TIFF,
FLAC, Ogg, animated GIF, WebP and PNG, QuickTime Animation) play from the
library's converted copy in `~/Library/Application Support/Tandem/Assets/
shared/<file>/`, which is made again when the file changes and a project
uses it (`refreshChangedSharedFiles`, run by every rescan: the app's
watcher, its scan at launch, a CLI search). The new copy is made beside the
old one and only replaces it once it's whole, so a change that can't be
converted leaves projects the last good one. Audio is measured for
loudness and a waveform but never copied to a 48 kHz WAV; LUTs and fonts
are used from the library too.

| Where the asset comes from | Using it in a project |
| --- | --- |
| Shared library (`shared:`) | referenced where it is; archiving copies it in |
| Import folder (`import:`) | copied into `assets/<kind>/` |
| Downloaded or generated (Noto, Iconify, SVGL, Fontsource, Pexels, Pixabay, ElevenLabs) | copied into `assets/<kind>/` |

**Segments.** A segment is a reusable bit of timeline (Mike's intro, outro,
like and subscribe, comment below): a `Template` of clips with their
offsets, the transitions between them and optional fields, plus copies of
every file those clips play (with a Live Photo's movie) and their LUTs,
beside `segment.json` in `Segments/<name>/`, so it keeps working whatever
happens to the project it came from. Save one with Timeline > Save
selection as segment… (or right-click a clip), `tandem segments save` or
`segments_save`; they're in the Text tab under Segments. Saving again
under the same name replaces it but keeps every file only the old version
had, since projects it went into play them from there. Inserting one is a
single `insertTemplate` whose media clips carry their media items, pointing
at the files in the segment's folder, so a project that lacks them gets them
added and one that has them reuses them. A clip whose file or look came from
the asset library carries the asset's ID as an `asset:<id>` tag, and the
credits count every asset a clip on the timeline names that way, so a Noto
sticker in an intro is still credited in every video the intro goes into.
See AGENTS.md for the commands.

## Shared files and archived projects

Effects, title styles and transitions are data built into Tandem (packs
later), so a project never needs their files. A project can still end up
using files from outside its folder: the shared library's files and the
converted copies of them, a segment's media, an import's absolute paths, a
sound from another video's folder, a LUT picked from Downloads, a font a
title names that's only installed on this Mac. Archiving (File > Archive
project…, `tandem archive`, see ARCHITECTURE.md) copies all of those into
the project folder and points the project at the copies, so the folder opens
on another Mac (Bruce) with nothing missing:

- shared library files into `media/Tandem Library/<where they were in it>`
  (`media/Tandem Library/Stickers/Star.mov`, `media/Tandem Library/Segments/
  Intro/sting.wav`), and the converted copy of one beside where its original
  would go, named after it (`media/Tandem Library/Stickers/Spin.mov` for
  `Stickers/Spin.webm`);
- other media into `media/<the folder it was in>/`;
- LUTs into `assets/lut/` and fonts into `assets/font/`.

With `--to <folder>` it writes a standalone copy of the whole folder there
instead. Fonts are looked for with Core Text first (fonts in
`/System/Library` come with every Mac and aren't copied), then in the shared
library's `Fonts/` and among the library's downloaded fonts, which the CLI
doesn't register. `archive.json` records where each file came from, so the
licence trail (the catalogue's usage and licence tables) can still be
followed from an archived copy. A project opened on another Mac without
being archived finds its shared files again by relinking: `tandem relink`
and the app look in that Mac's shared library after the project folder.

## Normalising on import (tested on this Mac)

- Alpha video: AVFoundation can't open WebM. Decode VP9 WebM with ffmpeg's
  `libvpx-vp9` decoder (the built-in one drops alpha), write ProRes 4444, then
  convert to HEVC with alpha via `AVAssetExportPresetHEVCHighestQualityWithAlpha`
  (a 5 s sticker: 520 KB WebM, 23 MB ProRes 4444, 386 KB HEVC-alpha). Don't use
  ffmpeg's `hevc_videotoolbox` for alpha; its output fails to decode.
- WebM colour: sticker WebMs are usually untagged YUV made with the BT.601
  matrix, ffmpeg's and browsers' default for RGB (all 51 Filmora sticker
  WebMs on this Mac, 37 VP8 and 14 VP9, are). Left untagged, the export
  guesses wrong: a small red square came out (245, 33, 0), and one Filmora
  sticker's greens averaged 25 levels high. So the ProRes frames are tagged
  with ffmpeg `setparams`, keeping the WebM's own tags where AVFoundation
  reads them and otherwise using BT.709 primaries and transfer (web stickers
  are sRGB) with the BT.601 matrix. VP9's BT.601 flag shows up as `bt470bg`,
  a matrix code AVFoundation doesn't read, so it becomes `smpte170m`, the
  same matrix. Full range is scaled to limited, since a MOV can't mark ProRes
  full range. The HEVC copy keeps the BT.601 matrix, and the compositor
  reads it: the red square renders (251, 0, 0).
- QuickTime Animation and PNG in a MOV (Storyblocks, Motion Array and older
  VideoHive sticker packs): macOS 26 can't decode either, so they go the
  WebM way through ffmpeg and ProRes 4444 to HEVC with alpha
  (`HEVCTranscoder`, shared with project media). Animation and PNG frames
  are RGB: they're converted with the BT.709 matrix and tagged, because
  untagged, the export guessed SMPTE-C for a small picture and turned red
  orange. Without ffmpeg the import fails and says to install it.
- Animated WebP and GIF: ImageIO decodes both with alpha and frame delays.
- Lottie: render offscreen with alpha (about 1.5 to 2.3 s for 140 frames at
  1024 square) into HEVC-alpha at import, so the renderer only sees video.
- SVG: `NSImage` renders SVG natively on macOS 26.
- Audio: decode at 48 kHz, measure LUFS and true peak, store waveform peaks.
  Default gains come from the audit: music -31 dB, SFX -15 dB.
- Fonts: register with `CTFontManagerRegisterFontURLs`.

## Browser

- Left rail: Music, SFX, Stickers, Overlays and B-roll, Titles, Transitions,
  Effects, LUTs, Fonts, Icons and logos. Each has Favourites, Recently used,
  Downloaded and In this project. Source chips across the top, with Shared
  library first; shared assets carry a "Shared library" chip of their own.
- The Text tab's Segments lists the shared library's saved segments as
  sketches of their tracks. Segments sit with the Text tab's templates, not
  the Graphics tab, because they are templates: a group of clips that go in
  together, linked, often with words that change, and the built-in Like and
  Subscribe and Comment Below templates they generalise are already there.
  The Graphics tab is for single files placed one at a time.
- Filters: duration, BPM, mood, has alpha, and licence (no credit, credit
  needed, subscription, AI).
- Tiles: hover-scrub for video and Lottie, audio plays from the hovered point
  of a waveform strip, Space for a big preview, hovering a transition, effect
  or title previews it on the selected clip.
- Downloads never block: insert the preview at once and swap in the original
  when it lands.
- The drop target decides: on a clip it applies, on a transition it
  replaces, on an empty track it makes a new clip.
- Similar (Freesound, Epidemic) and Generate (ElevenLabs variations, saving
  the prompt with the kept result).
- Credits panel builds the YouTube description credits.
- Agents get the same through `assets search`, `assets fetch`, `assets insert`
  and `assets credits` in the CLI and MCP.

## Decisions for Mike

- Decided 2026-09-29: Mike makes the Convex videos as a Convex employee, so
  Convex videos need company-channel licences (Epidemic Sound Business, not
  Pro; a Remotion company licence for Convex motion graphics). Tandem itself
  is for any project, so personal projects can use personal licences; the
  catalogue records each asset's licence so the credits and checks follow
  the project.
- The ElevenLabs key in the Keychain (`claude-code-music`) is restricted to
  music; turning on Sound Effects for it makes Generate work for SFX.
- Freesound stays off until its operator (UPF) agrees to commercial API use.
- Optional: Envato Core at $16.50/mo is the cheapest broad library whose
  licence covers client work (import folder, no API).

## The section card's sounds and fonts

The section card (RENDER.md) is part of Tandem, like the title presets,
so its typefaces ship with it; its two whooshes are ordinary library
assets, so their licence and every use are recorded.

- **Fonts.** Anton, Instrument Sans and JetBrains Mono, all SIL Open Font
  Licence 1.1 with no reserved names, unmodified from google/fonts
  (`Anton-Regular.ttf`, and the variable `InstrumentSans[wdth,wght].ttf`
  and `JetBrainsMono[wght].ttf` saved as `InstrumentSans-Variable.ttf` and
  `JetBrainsMono-Variable.ttf`, 544 KB together), with each licence beside
  it in `Sources/TandemRender/Resources/Fonts`. Bundled rather than taken
  from Fontsource because the renderer has to draw the card in every
  process, CLI exports included, and on Bruce, without anything installed.
- **Sounds.** Two soft, airy swishes made for the card with ElevenLabs on
  2026-09-30 on Mike's paid plan (commercial use, no credit), one a sweep
  (`SectionCardSounds` in TandemAPI names them). Both are takes of one
  prompt, asked for 1.0 s:

  > A soft airy swish of air moving quickly from left to right across the
  > stereo field, like a gentle gust of breath. Smooth and rounded: it
  > swells in, peaks softly in the middle and fades out cleanly. Light and
  > delicate, with no low end. No music, no voice.

  - in, `elevenlabs:sfx_4jhasduf`: the gentlest of three takes. A smooth
    swell with almost no low end (3% of its energy under 150 Hz), centred
    around 1.9 kHz, loudest 0.46 s in (-29.6 LUFS over its loudest
    400 ms). It starts with the card at -5.4 dB, so it peaks as the middle
    band crosses the frame.
  - out, `elevenlabs:sfx_k2dvisxs`: the next gentlest, a touch brighter
    (2.8 kHz) and lighter, loudest 0.40 s in (-26.7 LUFS). It starts with
    the sweep out at -8.3 dB.
  - `elevenlabs:sfx_yzs4v5qd`, the third take, is in the library, unused:
    half its energy is over 4 kHz, so it hisses.

  **Level.** The gains put both at -35 LUFS over their loudest 400 ms, 15
  LU under speech at Tandem's -20, which is where Mike's own section
  swipes sit in Decision Models (`swipe.wav`, `in.wav` and `out.wav` at
  -43.2 to -44.4 LUFS against his speech at -28.7). In a project whose
  speech plays elsewhere the gains move with it
  (`SectionCardSounds.Resolved.levelled(for:)`, from
  `AudioLevels.speechLevel(in:)`): the Decision Models import, whose
  speech plays at -28.7 until it's levelled, gets -14.1 and -17 dB.

  **Why they replaced the first pair.** Mike found the whoosh in "a
  little bit too much because it's a little bit jarring", an explosion.
  Measured: the first whoosh in (`elevenlabs:sfx_vda2xhs6`, "a big airy
  whoosh ... a little deeper than a light swoosh") had 73% of its energy
  under 150 Hz and a spectral centroid of 210 Hz, a low boom, and the
  steepest hit of the lot: within 20 dB of its peak it rose and fell about
  10 dB every 10 ms, where the new ones move about 4 to 5. The first
  whoosh out (`elevenlabs:sfx_2ybnc2tu`) had no boom (5% under 150 Hz,
  centred near 1 kHz) but a hard, spiky peak (its loudest 50 ms 6.9 dB over
  its loudest 300 ms, against 3.5 to 4.1 for the new ones) with 114
  clipped samples, so it went too. And they were loud: at -14 and -19 dB
  they sat 11 LU under speech at -20, and in the Decision Models demo,
  whose speech plays at -28.7, the whoosh in reached -16.1 LUFS in a mix
  mastered to -14, about as loud as Mike's voice. In the second demo the
  new pair reach -25.4 to -26.8 LUFS in the same kind of mix, 11 to 13 LU
  under the voice, and 9 to 12 LU under it where Mike talks over the sweep
  out.
  The first pair and a first take (`elevenlabs:sfx_2z7iwkfd`) stay in the
  library, unused. The measurements are in
  `~/dev/me/tandem-research/title-cards/tandem/sounds/`.
- **Into projects.** `tandem cards --apply`, the Section card tile (a
  double-click, or a drag, which copies them as it starts) and Timeline >
  Add section cards at section markers copy both into `assets/sfx/` with
  `use` before the edit, so the card and its sounds are one undo step.
  A Mac whose library doesn't have them makes silent cards and says so.
  To make them there, generate the prompt above (`tandem assets generate
  sfx "<prompt>" --duration 1 --variations 3`), measure the takes the same
  way and point `SectionCardSounds` at the two gentlest with their gains,
  or copy the two `elevenlabs/` asset folders across and rebuild the
  catalogue from disk (`AssetLibrary.rebuildCatalogFromDisk()`).

## Transition sounds

Push, slide, cut slide and wipe come with a sound effect in the app; the
rest are silent. Mike picks others per type in Tandem > Settings (kept in
the app's preferences as asset IDs), and `TransitionSoundDefaults` in
TandemAPI says what each type plays. Dropping a transition, double-clicking
one in the Effects tab, Cmd-D and changing a transition's type all copy the
type's sound into `assets/sfx/` with `use` first, so it's recorded like any
asset and goes in with the transition as one undo step. A Mac whose library
doesn't have the sound adds the transition silent and says so.

- **The light swoosh**, `elevenlabs:sfx_2ybnc2tu` ("A quick light swoosh
  sweeping from left to right as a stripe of colour slides off the
  screen...", 1.0 s, made on 2026-09-29): the one on a push in Mike's
  ESLint video, which he asked for on every push. It was the section
  card's first whoosh out, dropped there for its hard peak (its loudest
  50 ms 6.9 dB over its loudest 300 ms, 114 clipped samples; see above).
  It swells from the left, is loudest at 0.39 s as it crosses to the right,
  and tails off by 0.65 s.
- **When.** It starts 0.39 s before the transition's middle, so its
  loudest moment lands on the cut, where a push, slide or wipe moves
  fastest (their motion eases in and out). A longer transition is slower
  around the same moment, so the sound stays there.
- **Level.** Its loudest 400 ms is -11.7 LUFS, so -23.3 dB puts it at -35
  LUFS, 15 LU under speech at -20, where the section card whooshes sit
  (it was -19 dB on the old cards, 11 LU under). On the ESLint video's
  push it plays at -24.4 dB, about 16 LU under. The gain moves with a
  project whose speech plays elsewhere, as the cards' do
  (`Resolved.levelled(for:)`), and at that level its clipped peak sits
  23 dB under full scale in the mix.
- **Checked on an export.** A 12 s generated project (speech either side
  of a pause, a 0.7 s push on B-roll at 6 s playing the swoosh), exported
  at 1080p: the swoosh's loudest 10 ms at 5.999 s, its loudest 400 ms at
  -29.0 LUFS, 15.4 LU under the speech's median, and the file at -14.0
  LUFS with true peaks at -2.3 dBTP (the swoosh alone -17). The project
  and `check.py` are in `~/dev/me/tandem-research/transitions/`.
- **Other sounds** picked in Settings or the inspector are levelled the
  same way from the library's loudness measurement (15 LU under speech)
  and timed from its waveform (the middle of its loudest 50 ms on the
  transition's middle).

## Implementation (TandemAssets)

Built on the `tandem-assets` branch as the `TandemAssets` library (depends
on Core, Media and `lottie-ios`). Everything goes through `AssetLibrary`;
results are Codable so the CLI and MCP can return them as JSON.

| Need | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Open the library | `AssetLibrary()` (default root), `installStarterContent()` once |
| Source chips and status | `providerInfo()` |
| Browse and filter | `search(AssetQuery)`, `.favourites()`, `.recentlyUsed()`, `.inProject(id)`, `.downloaded()` |
| Search the sources | `searchProviders(ProviderQuery, providerIDs:)`, `similar(to:)` |
| Hover previews and tiles | `previewFile(for:)`, `waveform(for:)`, `url(for:.thumbnail)` |
| Download and normalise | `fetch(id)` (licence snapshot, normalise, thumbnail) |
| Generate | `generate(GenerationRequest)` (keeps every paid take, lists failures), `remove(id)` for takes not kept |
| Use in a project | `use(id, in:projectID:)` gives an `AssetPlacement`; `editCommands(at:in:)` adds and places it |
| Description credits | `credits(for: project, in: folder).text()`, plus `warnings`; `licenceHistory(id)` for disputes |
| Import folders | `addImportFolder(url, licence: FolderLicence.presets["envato"])`, `rescanImportFolders()`, `watchImportFolders` |
| Shared library | `sharedLibrary`, `createSharedLibrary()`, `rescanSharedLibrary()`, `watchSharedLibrary`, `refreshChangedSharedFiles(report)`, `moveSharedLibrary(to:)`, `registerSharedFonts()`; `SharedLibrary.locate()` for other processes |
| Fonts | `registerFonts()` at launch; a project's own `assets/font/` and the shared library's `Fonts/` (`ProjectFonts.libraryFolders`) are registered by whatever renders it (`ProjectFonts` in TandemRender) |
| Housekeeping | `prune()`, `evictUnpinnedFiles()`, `rebuildCatalogFromDisk()` |

An import folder's licence note is `tandem-licence.json` in the folder
(`source`, `licence`, `licenceClass`, `url`, `credit`, `certificate`,
`kind`, `notes`); presets exist for Envato, Mixkit, Pixabay, Sonniss, the
YouTube Audio Library, Epidemic, Artlist, Motion Array and Storyblocks.
Files in a folder without a note get the `unknown` licence class, and the
credits builder warns about them. Adding or correcting a note later
relicenses the folder's files on the next scan (the watcher sees the note
change), with a new snapshot for anything already used. A folder that
can't be read keeps its index rather than looking empty.

Choices made while building it:

- GIF, WebP and Lottie frames go straight into HEVC with alpha through
  `AVAssetWriter` (`.hevcWithAlpha`, premultiplied), which decodes with its
  alpha intact and skips the ProRes step. WebM still goes ffmpeg
  (`libvpx-vp9`) to ProRes 4444 to the HEVC-with-alpha export preset.
- 48 kHz PCM audio and anything over 20 minutes is measured (loudness,
  peaks) but used as it is, so a long stock bed doesn't become a 2 GB WAV.
- SVGs rasterise to 2048 px on the long side, Lottie to 1024 px. Iconify
  icons come in white for dark screens (`AssetSettings.iconColour`).
- Thumbnails with transparency are `thumbnail.png`, the rest
  `thumbnail.jpg`.
- ElevenLabs music uses `music_v2_5` and `mp3_48000_192`, as Mike's music
  scripts do. Sound effects ask for `pcm_48000` and wrap it in WAV.
- Keys are read with the `security` tool, never `SecItemCopyMatching`, so
  a headless run can't stall on a Keychain dialog.
- `SVGRasteriser` imports AppKit (NSImage is the only SVG renderer); it
  draws into its own bitmap, off the main thread.

Live check on 2026-09-25: Noto, Iconify, SVGL and Fontsource work end to
end. ElevenLabs music works; sound effects are refused with
`missing_permissions` (the key lacks `sound_generation`), which the
provider remembers and shows in its status. Pexels, Pixabay and Freesound
have no keys on this Mac and are tested against fixtures.

Tests: `swift test --package-path . --filter TandemAssetsTests`.
`TANDEM_LIVE_ASSETS=1` adds the free live tests; `TANDEM_LIVE_ELEVENLABS=1`
makes one paid sound effect and one paid music cue.
